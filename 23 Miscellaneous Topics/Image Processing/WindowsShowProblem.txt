What actually happens is that the Windows code relies on the fact that the default image viewer 
on Windows XP was able to work at blocking mode - this means that the command will wait until 
the image window will be closed. Because of that behaviour, they constructed a command line 
which deletes a file right after the image has been shown.

Windows Vista doesn't work the same way, it immediately returns once the command has been 
executed, so what happens now is that the temporary file gets immediately deleted by the 
command line, and the image viewer doesn't have enough time to load the image before it is 
being deleted.

Here is a quick workaround:

Edit C:\Python26\lib\site-packages\PIL\ImageShow.py, and around line 99, 
replace with the following line:

return "start /wait %s && PING 127.0.0.1 -n 5 > NUL && del /f %s" % (file, file)
